(Continues)
(General design and layout is actually finished but content is not ready.)


Mikroweb project is one of my first projects created for Mikronet Karbon with HTML & SASS & JS.

Project includes basic slide, intersectionObserver APÄ° and some of nice looking animations.

General layout is created with Css grid. Flexboxes are used in components mostly.
